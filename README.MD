# ```lets_be_rational```

This was forked from [lets_be_rational](https://github.com/vollib/lets_be_rational) so that this module along with [vollib](https://github.com/vollib/vollib) can be used in Python 3.5. Please refer to my documentation on my forked [vollib](https://github.com/carterkd/vollib) to see how to install this in conjunction with ```vollib``` on a computer with Python 3.5.
